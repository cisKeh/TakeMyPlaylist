# TakeMyPlaylist
<p>
This is a script to copy the artists of iTunes playlist from a music folder.<br/>
I found it more simple to take music from friend's playlist
</p>

## Before

Before use it, you need to export a playlist.xml from iTunes<br/>
<blockquote>file -> Library -> Export playlist -> Choose XML</blockquote>
</p>



## Usage

<blockquote> TakeMyPlaylist.py -x path/playlist.xml -s /source/path
 -d /destination/path </blockquote>
